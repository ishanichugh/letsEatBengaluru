                <h3>A Brief About Me</h3>
                <p>Punjabi Girl originating from a small town Hisar in Haryana, eldest in the family.
                    Being an introvert since childhood, my life has been a beautiful journey of many
                    ups and downs. Staying away from the house since 2011 life has been full of
                    challenges and lessons. Lived through so many different phases, self doubt, self
                    love, days with love and zest for live, days with depression and being scared of
                    my future holds, binge watching phases and so many more.</p>
                <p>Love for food and zest for going out and always looking forward to trying new
                    things has always stayed the same. I started exploring food after I started getting
                    teaching stipend from my college. About two years later got to know about the restaurants
                    review platform Zomato. Sharing my food reviews made the exploration even more exciting.
                    Almost a year down from that instagram became popular, providing even better platform
                    for the same, but limited to images and videos. So here I am, imparting a glimpse of my
                    experience with you guys, hoping that it will help you have a better time ❤️.
